Haxe client for Faer. Only supports the C++ target.
There are quite a few breaking changes compared to other sources, for a reference server implementation see [faer-srv](https://github.com/tdm42/faer-srv)
Depends on [hxdiscord_rpc](https://github.com/MAJigsaw77/hxdiscord_rpc), can be installed with ```haxelib git hxdiscord_rpc https://github.com/MAJigsaw77/hxdiscord_rpc.git```
